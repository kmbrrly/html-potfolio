<h3>Beauty and the Beast</h3>
<p>
An arrogant prince is cursed to live as a terrifying beast until he finds true love. <br/>
Strangely, his chance comes when he captures an unwary clockmaker, whose place is then taken by his bold and beautiful daughter Belle. <br />
Helped by the Beast's similarly enchanted servants, including a clock, a teapot and a candelabra, <br />
Belle begins to see the sensitive soul behind the fearsome facade. <br />
But as time runs out, it soon becomes obvious that Belle's cocky suitor Gaston is the real beast of the piece.

<h3>Maleficent</h3>
<p>

has an idyllic life in a forest kingdom. When an invading army threatens 
the land, Maleficent rises up to become its fiercest protector. 
However, a terrible betrayal hardens her heart and twists her into a 
creature bent on revenge. She engages in an epic battle with the invading 
king's successor, then curses his newborn daughter, 
Aurora -- realizing only later that the child holds the key to peace in the 
kingdom.
